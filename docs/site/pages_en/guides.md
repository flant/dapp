<p>We will gradually consider all the tasks related to developing services and implementing the CI/CD process: building, deploying, working with dependencies and assets, working with databases and in-memory storage, using e-mail and file storage, implementing autotests, and more.</p>

<p>Each version of the tutorial takes into account the specifics of the programming language/framework and includes examples of the application source code and infrastructure (IaC).</p>
